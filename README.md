# NyaaTorrentFinder
This program uses the RSS feed of Nyaa.si to find relevant torrents with a good seed/leech ratio. It even provides a "beautifull" interface to do all your searching! 

Because this program parses the XML file returned by the RSS feed it is extremely fast. It also circumvents all the ads and gives you the direct download link to the torrent. When you chose a torrent it will automatically download and open in your favorite torrent program.
